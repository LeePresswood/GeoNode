GeoNode is an Android application that uses the geolocation of a phone to participate in a social game.

As the player goes the activities of the day, they will travel to various locations in town. At any point during these travels, they may place a GeoNode. Players are given 10 of these every day.

The social aspect comes in the fact that every player has the same ability to place GeoNodes. Should you cross the GeoNode of another player, that player will receive a point. The highest scorers at the end of each day will appear on the leaderboard.
